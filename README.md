# Knowledge checkpoint

Express is a massive topic, and we have covered a lot of ground. It's easy to get lost in the details, so here's a list of what you absolutely must be able to do:

## Can you...

- create a new express app?
- listen for GET requests?
- make some text show up in the browser?
- render a static template?
- render a template with data?
- make your route paths dynamic? (e.g. `/albums/:albumId`)
- show a form?
- listen for POST requests?
- read the data entered into the form?

# Suggested practice

In case you want to solidify your knowledge with some exercise, here is an example small express apps you can build:

A contacts app with the following routes:

- `GET  /contacts` shows the names of all contacts
- `GET  /contacts/:id` shows the info for a single contact
- `GET  /contacts/create` shows a form for adding a contact
- `POST /contacts/create` saves the data from the form

Some starter data is included in this repo as `data.json`

# Additional practice

To get more familiar with building backends, create some sample data and build apps for:

- pets
- movies
- cars
- video games
- tv shows

Try implementing the four kinds of routes listed above for each of these apps.# backend-checkpoint
